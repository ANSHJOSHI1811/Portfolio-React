# Portfolio - React with SCSS

Welcome to my portfolio project! In this project, I have created a personal portfolio website using React and SCSS. The portfolio showcases my skills, projects, and achievements, allowing visitors to learn more about my professional background and expertise.

## Project Overview

The portfolio website is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and SCSS, a CSS preprocessor that enhances the styling capabilities. By combining the power of React and SCSS, I have developed a responsive and visually appealing portfolio that highlights my work and accomplishments.

## Features

- **React Components**: Utilize React's component-based structure to create modular and reusable sections for the portfolio website, such as the header, about me, projects, skills, and contact sections.
- **Responsive Design**: Implement a responsive layout using CSS and media queries in SCSS, ensuring that the portfolio website adapts to different screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal viewing experience.
- **Project Showcase**: Showcase my projects with detailed descriptions, images, and links, allowing visitors to explore and interact with my work.
- **Skills and Expertise**: Highlight my skills, expertise, and technologies I am proficient in, demonstrating my capabilities to potential employers or collaborators.
- **Contact Form**: Include a contact form or contact information, enabling visitors to get in touch with me easily.
- **SCSS Styling**: Leverage SCSS's features such as variables, mixins, nesting, and inheritance to write modular and reusable styles for the portfolio website, making it easier to maintain and update the visual design.
- **Dynamic Content**: Utilize React's state management to update and display dynamic content, making it easy to update and maintain the portfolio website.
